            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>1 pound fettuccine or linguine, spaghetti, etc</li>
               <li>3 pints cherry tomatoes halved</li>
               <li>1 medium onion diced</li>
               <li>1 stick unsalted butter</li>
               <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
               <li>¼ cup parsley minced</li>
               <li>¼ cup basil hand torn</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  In a large pan saute the onion in butter over medium-low heat until soft (about 5 minutes) then 
                  add the tomatoes. Season the tomatoes initially with a teaspoon of kosher salt.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Cook the sauce over medium heat for 30-35 minutes (stir frequently and lower heat if scorching) 
                  or until the cherry tomatoes have burst and softened and the butter has completely blended 
                  in with the tomatoes.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted (2 tablespoons kosher salt per gallon of water) water to boil.
                  When the sauce is almost to your liking begin boiling the fettuccine to 1 minute less than al dente.
               </li>
               <li>
                  A few minutes before the pasta finishes cooking add 1 cup of pasta water to the sauce and stir 
                  to combine. Continue to cook the sauce over medium heat.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Add the pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. Cook until the pasta is just al dente then turn off the heat
                  and season to taste with more salt and pepper as required. Add the herbs, toss once more, then plate.
                  If the sauce is at all dry, add more of the reserved pasta water a few ounces at a time to loosen it up.
                  Serve with grated parmesan cheese. Enjoy!
               </li>
            </ol>

               with spaghetti in a tomato-based, creamy brandy sauce. Topped with plenty 
               of grated Parmigiano Reggiano and fresh Italian parsley, this dish 
               can be prepared in about 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/mushroompasta.jpg" width="400px" alt="Creamy Brandy mushroom pasta picture" />
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>1 pound spaghetti linguine, fettuccine, etc.</li>
               <li>3 tablespoon olive oil</li>
               <li>1 ½ pounds baby Bella (cremini) mushrooms ¼-inch thick slices</li>
               <li>1 medium onion diced</li>
               <li>3 ounces tomato paste</li>
               <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
               <li>1 cup Brandy</li>
               <li>½ cup Parmigiano Reggiano grated</li>
               <li>2 cups reserved pasta water will most likely not need it all</li>
               <li>¼ cup Italian parsley minced</li>
               <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  Bring a large pot of salted water (2 tablespoons kosher salt per gallon) to a boil.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Heat a large pan to medium heat. Add the olive oil and mushrooms. Sear mushrooms 
                  until they release their water and brown (about 3-5 minutes per side). Once browned 
                  season with a bit of salt and pepper and remove mushrooms to a plate and tent with foil.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Turn the heat to medium-low and add in the onion. Saute for 5-7 minutes or until translucent 
                  and soft. If the pan is dry add 1-2 tablespoons more olive oil. After the onions are soft 
                  add the tomato paste to the pan and cook for 5 minutes stirring frequently.
               </li>
               <li>
                  At this point begin boiling the spaghetti to 1 minute less than al dente.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Add the Brandy to the pan and turn the heat to high. With a wooden spoon scrape the brown bits
                  off the bottom of the pan. Once the alcohol smell has gone away and the liquid has reduced 
                  by about half (about 2 minutes) turn the heat down to medium and add 1 cup of pasta water.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Cook for 2 more minutes then add the cream. Bring to a simmer to allow the sauce to thicken.
                  Taste test and season with salt and pepper to taste.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Add the mushrooms to the sauce along with the pasta. Cook until the pasta is just al dente
                  then turn off the heat and remove the pan from the stovetop.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Add the cheese along with the parsley and mix together well. If the sauce is too dry add more
                  of the reserved pasta water, a bit at a time, to get the consistency just right. Enjoy!
               </li>
            </ol>
